Q4 Do eligible people need to register afresh in order to receive
the first-instalment voucher on 16 April?
A4 We will disburse the relevant consumption voucher directly to
the registered SVF account of eligible people (registrants using
Octopus need to tap their cards for collection) based on the
registration information of 2022 CVS. If the registered SVF
account of the relevant person is still valid, there is no need to
go through any procedure.

CVS on 16 April if they have not registered under 2022 CVS?

(Phase II) CVS last year register now to receive the
consumption voucher which has already been disbursed

middle of the year.

need to have collected all the vouchers disbursed under 2022
(Phase II) CVS by tapping their cards?

Fujian Scheme (“FJS”) receive the benefit?

the first-instalment voucher disbursed under 2023 CVS directly
via the concerned account on 16 April.
Q9 Can people receive the benefit if they are staying overseas
temporarily or serving sentences abroad?
A9 If people who have successfully registered under 2022 CVS are

are not malfunctioned (including relevant Octopus card not
returned or lost). They can receive the relevant voucher directly
via the concerned account on 16 April.
Q10 Can registrants with special needs continue to collect the
consumption voucher through their agents? Can they
change the relevant agent?

A10 If the relevant registrant is a recipient of the Comprehensive
Social Security Assistance or Social Security Allowance
payments under the existing appointee system of the Social
Welfare Department (“SWD”) and his/her agent is an
“authorised representative” (“AR”) appointed by the Director of
Social Welfare as a guardian/appointee/agent, we will disburse
the first-instalment voucher under 2023 CVS to the AR
concerned on 16 April according to the latest information
provided by the SWD and the registrant or his/her AR is not
required to register again. If there is a change in the registrant’s
AR after his/her registration in 2022 CVS, we will contact the
new AR and update the registration record.
Q11 Can eligible people who have passed away receive the first-
instalment voucher on 16 April?
A11 Consumption voucher will not be disbursed on 16 April to
eligible people who have passed away after successfully
registered under 2022 CVS. The family members of the
deceased cannot receive the consumption voucher on his/her
behalf.
B Disbursement and Usage of Consumption Voucher
Q12 What is the timetable for the disbursement of first-
instalment and second-instalment vouchers?
A12 For those who use AlipayHK, BoC Pay, PayMe from HSBC,
Tap & Go or WeChat Pay HK to receive consumption vouchers,
they will receive the first-instalment voucher of $3,000 or
5
$1,500 on 16 April. Provided that the relevant registrants meet
the eligibility criteria of 2023 CVS (the relevant eligibility
criteria will be announced later), they will receive the second-
instalment voucher of $2,000 or $1,000 on 16 July.
For those who use Octopus to receive consumption vouchers, the
first-instalment voucher of $3,000 or $1,500 will be disbursed to
them on 16 April, with the deadline for collection on 30
September 2023. Provided that the relevant registrants meet the
eligibility criteria of 2023 CVS (the relevant eligibility criteria
will be announced later), and their cumulative total “eligible
spending” has reached $3,000 or $1,500 during the period from
30 June to 31 October this year, they will be disbursed with the
second-instalment voucher of $2,000 or $1,000 on the 16th of the
following month after the target eligible spending has been
reached.
Q13 What is the scope of coverage for the 2023 voucher?

scope of coverage as that of the vouchers disbursed under 2022

service outlets or their online platforms which accept payments
by AlipayHK, BoC Pay, PayMe from HSBC, Octopus, Tap &
Go and WeChat Pay HK. For details, please click here.

A14 The first-instalment and second-instalment vouchers disbursed
6
via the five e-wallets under 2023 CVS on 16 April and 16 July
will be valid until 31 October 2023 and 31 January 2024

April will receive the first-instalment voucher of $3,000 or
$1,500 in one go on 16 April. Their cumulative total “eligible
spending” should reach $3,000 or $1,500 during the period from

eligibility criteria of 2023 CVS (the relevant eligibility criteria

second-instalment voucher of $2,000 or $1,000 via Octopus on
the 16th of the following month after the target eligible spending
has been reached.
C Stored Value Facility (“SVF”) Account
Q16 Can people change their SVF to receive the first-instalment
voucher disbursed under 2023 CVS on 16 April?
A16 In order to disburse the voucher the soonest possible under 2023
CVS, eligible people must use the same SVF registered under
2022 CVS for receiving the first-instalment voucher disbursed
on 16 April. If the account is malfunctioned, cancelled or lost,
relevant people can only use another account under the same
SVF to receive the voucher. People who wish to switch to
another SVF to receive the voucher can do so when registration
7
for 2023 CVS is accepted in the middle of the year. The same
SVF account cannot be used for registration by more than one
registrant for receiving consumption vouchers.
Q17 What should people do if they are not sure if the SVF
accounts registered under 2022 CVS are still valid?
A17 In general, unless people cancel the SVF account on their own
accord (e.g. returned the Octopus card), the account which has
not been used for a period of time will still be valid. If in doubt,
people can call the relevant SVF operator’s hotline to check if
their SVF accounts registered under 2022 CVS are still valid.
Q18 What should people do if they have cancelled their SVF
account registered for receiving 2022 (Phase II)
consumption voucher, lost their Octopus card, or if their
accounts have become invalid?
A18 If people who have used AlipayHK, BoC Pay, PayMe from
HSBC, Tap & Go or WeChat Pay HK to collect consumption
vouchers in 2022 have already removed the relevant mobile app,
or cancelled the e-wallet account, they can first try to re-install
the relevant mobile app and log into their original account again
by inputting the relevant information such as their account
number and password. Failing that, eligible people may first
contact the relevant SVF operators to address the issue of their
invalid accounts.
If the invalid account cannot be re-activated, the eligible people
will need to open a new account with the same SVF. They can
amend the e-wallet account registration record through the
8
designated website (click here) to receive the first-instalment
voucher disbursed under 2023 CVS on 16 April.
For eligible people whose Octopus card registered under 2022
CVS has been lost or malfunctioned, they can amend their
Octopus card registration record through the designated website
(click here) to use another Octopus card to collect the first-
instalment voucher disbursed under 2023 CVS on 16 April. The
old Octopus card will be invalidated.

Q19 Do people need to provide the registration reference
number (“RRN”) under 2022 CVS when they amend their
SVF account through the designated website? If people have
forgotten the reference number, how can they obtain it?
A19 People who wish to amend their SVF account through the
designated website are required to provide their RRN under
2022 CVS for verification of identity. People can retrieve their
RRN from the previous SMS sent by the Consumption Voucher
Scheme Secretariat using the specified telephone number
6059 1120. If they have deleted the SMS or have forgotten the
9
RRN, they can call the hotline 18 5000 or visit the eight
temporary service centres (please refer to Q22 for the addresses
of centres). After simple authentication of identity, they will
receive the RRN through SMS.
Q20 Can people who have registered 2022 CVS using Octopus
switch to use JoyYou card to receive the first-instalment
voucher under 2023 CVS on 16 April?
A20 People who have registered under 2022 CVS using Octopus may
continue to use the registered Octopus card to receive the
voucher if their registered Octopus card is still valid. They do
not need to register afresh or change to another Octopus card
(including JoyYou card) to receive the first-instalment voucher
disbursed under 2023 CVS on 16 April. If JoyYou card users
have returned their Octopus card registered under 2022 CVS,
they can call the Octopus hotline at 2969 5588 on or before 29
March to amend their registration record. After the amendments,
the old Octopus card will be invalidated. JoyYou card users may
also use the “Easy Transfer” service at Octopus Service Points
to transfer the settings in their old Octopus card (including the
relevant data of CVS, e.g. collection and eligible spending
records, as well as other information, e.g. Automatic Add Value
Service, access control systems, etc.) to their JoyYou card after
they have received the voucher. The old Octopus card will be
revoked.
Q21 Is it necessary for registrant who has transferred their
physical Octopus card registered under 2022 CVS to
Octopus card on Mobile to update their registration record
in order to receive the first-instalment voucher disbursed
10
under 2023 CVS on 16 April?
A21 Relevant people do not need to update the registration record.
We will arrange to update the registration record under the CVS
on our own accord to let the relevant people use Octopus card
on mobile to receive the first-instalment voucher under 2023
CVS on 16 April.
Q22 How can people update their invalid/lost SVF account if they
have no knowledge on Internet?
